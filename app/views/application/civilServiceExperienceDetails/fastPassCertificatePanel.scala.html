                   Fast Pass allows you to be fast tracked to the final stages of the Fast Stream selection process. You won't
                   need to do the online tests (online exercises, work based scenarios and video interview). You can apply using
                   your Fast Pass if you have not used it before.

               <p>Some schemes require you to pass the additional information stage before attending the assessment centre.</p>
