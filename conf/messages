# Phase3 feedback
phase3.feedback.capability.feedbackOnPerformance.High=Your responses to the Video Interview shows high capability – offering specific, compelling and detailed evidence across criteria. Such a capability is an important foundation in developing the necessary skills to succeed on the Fast Stream.
phase3.feedback.capability.feedbackOnPerformance.Medium=Your responses to the Video Interview shows generally good evidence of operating effectively across criteria. Your performance suggests you can demonstrate some capability, but you may not yet be fully developed to succeed on Fast Stream.
phase3.feedback.capability.feedbackOnPerformance.Low=Your responses to the Video Interview shows limited evidence in terms of operating effectively across criteria. Clear development needed before you can succeed on the Fast Stream.
phase3.feedback.capability.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.High=To sustain or enhance your performance in this area further, regularly reflect on the effectiveness of your actions. Are there situations where you can improve your performance to ensure a strong outcome?  What can you learn from these experiences to hone your judgements in the future?
phase3.feedback.capability.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.Medium=Although you performed well in this assessment, your performance in this area might be enhanced further by making sure that you fully reflect on what actions are  most likely to deliver effective outcomes to best serve the needs of the task. Before taking an action ask yourself whether this is most likely to deliver the required outcome. After encountering such issues reflect on the outcomes; what might you learn going forwards to enhance your actions?
phase3.feedback.capability.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.Low=When in situations where you need to take action, ensure that you consider whether you have given full consideration to the context of the situation.   When faced with taking action, consider whether you have thought through the impact of each course of action.  Were there alternatives that were more likely to meet the needs of the situation?   What can you learn that can help you make better judgements in the future?
phase3.feedback.engagement.feedbackOnPerformance.High=Your responses to the Video Interview displayed very clear willingness, desire and motivation. High engagement and enthusiasm was evident across different question areas at a level  suitable to succeed on the Fast Stream.

phase3.feedback.engagement.feedbackOnPerformance.Low=Your responses to the Video Interview displayed limited engagement and motivation around the question areas. These areas are possibly not genuine preferences in terms of what you enjoy doing and therefore you may not  yet be suitable to succeed on the Fast Stream.
phase3.feedback.engagement.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.High=Aim to continue your motivation and engagement in situations. Think about what it is that you find motivating and build on these areas by becoming more involved and skilled. For those areas you find less energising aim to be as engaged as possible in order to meet objectives.
phase3.feedback.engagement.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.Medium=Aim to develop your motivation and engagement in situations. Think about what it is that you find motivating and build on these areas by becoming more involved and skilled. For those areas you find less energising aim to be engaged as possible in order to meet objectives.
phase3.feedback.engagement.suggestionsForFurtherDevelopment.Low=Aim to enhance your motivation and engagement in situations. Think about what it is that you find motivating and build on these areas by becoming more involved and skilled.
